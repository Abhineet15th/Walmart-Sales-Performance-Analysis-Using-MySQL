# Walmart-Sales-Performance-Analysis-Using-MySQL
An advanced SQL project analyzing Walmart's sales trends, customer behaviour, and product performance using complex queries, CTEs, and window functions.


📌 **Overview:**  
This project focuses on analyzing **Walmart's sales performance** using **advanced MySQL queries**. The dataset includes **transaction details, customer demographics, product lines, sales figures, and payment methods**. By leveraging SQL, I have performed in-depth data analysis to uncover key insights related to **sales trends, customer behavior, and operational efficiency**.  

Additionally, all SQL analysis has been **visualized in Power BI** through **reports and visuals**, enhancing data interpretation and business insights. 📊  

💡 **Key Objectives:**  
✔ Identify the **top-performing branch** based on **sales growth rate** 📈  
✔ Determine the **most profitable product line** for each branch 💰  
✔ **Segment customers** based on spending behavior (High, Medium, Low spenders) 👥  
✔ Detect **anomalies in sales transactions** for fraud detection 🚨  
✔ Find the **most popular payment method** in each city 💳  
✔ Analyze **monthly sales distribution by gender** 👨‍💼👩‍💼  
✔ Identify **best-selling product lines** based on customer type 🛒  
✔ Detect **repeat customers** and their purchase frequency 🔄  
✔ Discover the **top 5 customers by sales volume** 🏆  
✔ Analyze **sales trends by day of the week** to optimize strategies 📅  

📊 **SQL Techniques Used:**  
- **CTEs & Window Functions** for ranking, segmentation, and trend analysis  
- **Aggregate Functions** (SUM, AVG, COUNT) for data summarization  
- **Joins & Subqueries** for complex data relationships  
- **Case Statements** for customer segmentation  
- **Date Functions** for trend analysis and anomaly detection  

📈 **Power BI Visualizations & Reports:**  
- **Various visual representations** to analyze sales trends, customer behavior, and key performance metrics.  
- **Charts, graphs, and tables** to provide a clearer understanding of the data.  
- **Insights derived from SQL analysis** are presented through **detailed Power BI reports**.
